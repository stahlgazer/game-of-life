# Project Title
Game of Life

## Description
'The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.' - Wikipedia

## Key Features
* An empty cell represents a dead cell, while a filled cell is a live cell. Your cell's survival is reliant on its neighbors and position on the grid. First select cells to start with that are alive, or choose the 'randomize cells' button. Check out the different settings and experiment with different configurations to see what kind of results you come up with, then sit back and watch. Check out the rules to see what will make your cells live or die so that you can choose wisely.
